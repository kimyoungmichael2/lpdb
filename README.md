# **License Plate Database Live-Demo**

This is a forked project from the [License Plate Database](https://github.com/hanbeul/lpdb), with incomplete features removed and sample data added for demonstration purposes. A link for a live version is available at <https://michaelyoung.kim>.  

LPDB is an application that recognizes license plates from a live video stream and stores them in a database. It is currently being developed to help a local car wash business track their customers' visits. This will allow the car wash to start loyal customer reward program (i.e. 10th car wash free) as well as gain business analytics.

## Ultimate ALPR

This project uses the [Ultimate ALPR](https://github.com/DoubangoTelecom/ultimateALPR-SDK) library for the deep learning based license plate recognition.
